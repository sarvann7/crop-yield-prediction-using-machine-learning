# crop-yield-prediction-using-machine-learning
This project, titled "Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning ", aims to utilize the power of machine learning, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, to predict crop yields based on various environmental and agricultural factors such as rainfall, fertilizer usage, and geographical data. The goal is to provide accurate yield predictions for different crops across Indian states, assisting farmers and policymakers in making informed decisions for resource allocation and crop planning. The system processes historical agricultural data, cleans and pre-processes it, then uses the Random Forest model to make predictions. A web-based interface allows users to input data and receive predictions in real time.
